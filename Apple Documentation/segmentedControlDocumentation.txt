Overview
A segmented control can display a title (an NSString object) or an image (UIImage object). The UISegmentedControl object automatically resizes segments to fit proportionally within their superview unless they have a specific width set. When you add and remove segments, you can request that the action be animated with sliding and fading effects.
You register the target-action methods for a segmented control using the valueChanged constant as shown below.

segmentedControl.addTarget(self, action: "action:", forControlEvents: .valueChanged)

How you configure a segmented control can affect its display behavior:
If you set a segmented control to have a momentary style, a segment doesn’t show itself as selected (blue background) when the user touches it. The disclosure button is always momentary and doesn’t affect the actual selection.
In versions of iOS prior to 3.0, if a segmented control has only two segments, then it behaves like a switch — tapping the currently-selected segment causes the other segment to be selected. In iOS 3.0 and later, tapping the currently-selected segment doesn’t cause the other segment to be selected.

Customize appearance
You can customize the appearance of segmented controls using the methods listed in Customizing appearance. You can customize the appearance of all segmented controls using the appearance proxy (for example, [UISegmentedControl appearance]), or just of a single control.
When customizing appearance, in general, you should specify a value for the normal state of a property to be used by other states which don’t have a custom value set. Similarly, when a property is dependent on the bar metrics (on the iPhone in landscape orientation, bars have a different height from standard), you should make sure you specify a value for UIBarMetrics.default.
In the case of the segmented control, appearance properties for landscapePhone are only respected for segmented controls in the smaller navigation and toolbars that are used in landscape orientation on the iPhone.
To provide complete customization, you need to provide divider images for different state combinations, using setDividerImage(_:forLeftSegmentState:rightSegmentState:barMetrics:):
// Image between two unselected segments.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal,
                                   rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)
 
// Image between segment selected on the left and unselected on the right.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Selected,
                                   rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)
 
// Image between segment selected on the right and unselected on the left.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal,
                                   rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Selected, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)

Topics
Creating a segmented control
init(items: [Any]?)
Creates a segmented control with segments having the given titles or images.
convenience init(frame: CGRect, actions: [UIAction])
Creates a segmented control with the given frame and adds segments for the actions you specify.
init(frame: CGRect)
Creates an empty segmented control with the frame you specify.
init?(coder: NSCoder)

func insertSegment(withTitle: String?, at: Int, animated: Bool)
Inserts a segment at the position you specify and gives it a title as content.
func removeAllSegments()
Removes all segments of the segmented control.
func removeSegment(at: Int, animated: Bool)
Removes the segment you specify from the segmented control, optionally animating the transition.
var selectedSegmentIndex: Int
The index number that identifies the selected segment that the user last touched.
class var noSegment: Int
A segment index value indicating that there’s no selected segment.
Managing segment behavior and appearance
var isMomentary: Bool
A Boolean value that determines whether segments in the segmented control show selected state.
func setEnabled(Bool, forSegmentAt: Int)
Enables the segment you specify.
func isEnabledForSegment(at: Int) -> Bool
Returns whether the indicated segment is enabled.
func setContentOffset(CGSize, forSegmentAt: Int)
Adjusts the offset for drawing the content (image or text) of the specified segment.
func contentOffsetForSegment(at: Int) -> CGSize
Returns the offset for drawing the content (image or text) of the segment you specify.
func setWidth(CGFloat, forSegmentAt: Int)
Sets the width of the segment at the index you specify.
func widthForSegment(at: Int) -> CGFloat
Returns the width of the segment at the index you specify.
var apportionsSegmentWidthsByContent: Bool
Indicates whether the control attempts to adjust segment widths based on their content widths.
Customizing appearance
var selectedSegmentTintColor: UIColor?
The color to use for highlighting the currently selected segment.
func backgroundImage(for: UIControl.State, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics) -> UIImage?
Returns the background image for a given state and bar metrics.

enum Segment
Constants for specifying a segment in a control.
func dividerImage(forLeftSegmentState: UIControl.State, rightSegmentState: UIControl.State, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics) -> UIImage?
Returns the divider image used for a given combination of left and right segment states and bar metrics.
func setDividerImage(UIImage?, forLeftSegmentState: UIControl.State, rightSegmentState: UIControl.State, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics)
