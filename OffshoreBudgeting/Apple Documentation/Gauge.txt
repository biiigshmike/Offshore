struct Gauge<Label, CurrentValueLabel, BoundsLabel, MarkedValueLabels> where Label : View, CurrentValueLabel : View, BoundsLabel : View, MarkedValueLabels : View

Overview
A gauge is a view that shows a current level of a value in relation to a specified finite capacity, very much like a fuel gauge in an automobile. Gauge displays are configurable; they can show any combination of the gaugeâ€™s current value, the range the gauge can display, and a label describing the purpose of the gauge itself.

You can make a gauge more descriptive by describing its purpose, showing its current value and its start and end values. This example shows the gauge variant that accepts a range and adds labels using multiple trailing closures describing the current value and the minimum and maximum values of the gauge:

struct LabeledGauge: View {
    @State private var current = 67.0
    @State private var minValue = 0.0
    @State private var maxValue = 170.0


    var body: some View {
        Gauge(value: current, in: minValue...maxValue) {
            Text("BPM")
        } currentValueLabel: {
            Text("\(Int(current))")
        } minimumValueLabel: {
            Text("\(Int(minValue))")
        } maximumValueLabel: {
            Text("\(Int(maxValue))")
        }
    }
}
