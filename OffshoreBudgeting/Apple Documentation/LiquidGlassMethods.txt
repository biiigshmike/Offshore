) -> some View

Discussion
When you use this effect, the system:
Renders a shape anchored behind a view with the Liquid Glass material.
Applies the foreground effects of Liquid Glass over a view.
For example, to add this effect to a Text:
Text("Hello, World!")
    .font(.title)
    .padding()
    .glassEffect()
SwiftUI uses the regular variant by default along with a Capsule shape.
SwiftUI anchors the Liquid Glass to a view’s bounds. For the example above, the material fills the entirety of the Text frame, which includes the padding.
You typically use this modifier with a GlassEffectContainer to combine multiple Liquid Glass shapes into a single shape that can morph into one another.

struct GlassEffectContainer<Content> where Content : View

Overview
Use a container with the glassEffect(_:in:) modifier. Each view with a Liquid Glass effect contributes a shape rendered with the effect to a set of shapes. SwiftUI renders the effects together, improving rendering performance and allowing the effects to interact with and morph into one another.
Configure how shapes interact with one another by customizing the default spacing value of the container. As shapes near one another, their paths start to blend into one another. The higher the spacing, the sooner blending begins as the shapes approach each other.

Initializers
init(spacing: CGFloat?, content: () -> Content)
Creates a glass effect container with the provided spacing, extracting glass shapes from the provided content.

Type Properties
static var identity: GlassEffectTransition
The identity transition specifying no changes.
static var matchedGeometry: GlassEffectTransition
Returns the matched geometry glass effect transition.
static var materialize: GlassEffectTransition
The materialize glass effect transition which will fade in content and animate in or out the glass material but will not attempt to match the geometry of any other glass effects.
